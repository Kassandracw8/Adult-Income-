# Adult-Income-
## Overview
This data set contains information about age, gender, occupation, education, workclass of 32,000 people from US. I have created a machine learning model to predict whether a salary of a person is greater than $50K or not.
The project involved data assessment and cleaning, performing EDA and drawing conclusions from the data.
# Technologies Used
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Gender:- Out of total male 30% of them earn salary more than 50K while less than 15% female earn more than 50K. 89% female earn less than 50K. It very insterting that males earn more than females. Much of the gender pay gap has been explained by measurable factors such as educational attainment, occupational segregation and work experience.

Marital status :- 41% of married people seem to earn salary greater than 50K. American Economic Journal: "Macroeconomics suggests that much of it comes down to the economic support offered by having a partner"

Using the RandomForest model would be th best to predict what factors make someone have a high income. Fromt the training model to the tune model the Random Forest was simialr in accuracy.
