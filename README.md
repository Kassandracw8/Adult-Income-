# Adult-Income-
## Overview
This data set contains information about age, gender, occupation, education, workclass of 32,000 people from US. I have created a machine learning model to predict whether a salary of a person is greater than $50K or not.
The project involved data assessment and cleaning, performing EDA and drawing conclusions from the data.
# Technologies Used
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

Gender:- Out of total male 30% of them earn salary more than 50K while less than 15% female earn more than 50K. 89% female earn less than 50K. It very insterting that males earn more than females. Much of the gender pay gap has been explained by measurable factors such as educational attainment, occupational segregation and work experience.

Marital status :- 41% of married people seem to earn salary greater than 50K. American Economic Journal: "Macroeconomics suggests that much of it comes down to the economic support offered by having a partner"

Using the RandomForest model would be the best to predict what factors make someone have a high income. Fromt the training model to the tune model the Random Forest was simialr in accuracy.


# Rcommendations
Data Science Insights 

 * From the data set that was given if you were male, white, married and had a high level of education your income was above 50,0000.
 * If we made college more affordable there might be chance for some races to recieved a high education as well.

* As for the pay gap between men and women. The solutions include raising the minimum wage, promoting transparent pay practices, increasing workplace unionization, and providing robust paid family and medical leave for workers. Making these changes at the individual, company, state, and national level could go a long way towards achieving equal pay for equal work.





# Limitations & Next Steps
This data set is from 1994 a plenty has change since then. It would be instersting to do the the study with this current time period.
